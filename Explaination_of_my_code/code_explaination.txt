1> "User Registration and Authentication:"--

->First User have to Register into database. I have register one user email:teethi@gmail.com, password: Teethi@123.
->Then User have to login for accessing task dashboard.
->After that if user wants to log out, they can log out easily, after log out from browser they can't  access tasks dashboard page.

2> "Task Management:"

->After login user can Create, read, update and delete tasks.
->There are Task Modal with the attributes : title, description, status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed), and due date. 


3> "Task Filtering and Sorting:"

->After login user can sort tasks in Ascending order and Descending order.
->After login user can filter tasks by status .
